# HL-firmware
Source for Hardlight control firmware. 

### Building
This firmware was written in the ARM MBED online compiler for the STM32F401RE on the Hardlight Control board. For best results, compile using the ARMCC compiler. Not tested for GCC. 

### Documentation
See Packets-doc.txt for more information about the Hardlight command set. 

### Please note:
We have decided to open the code in the hopes that others may make use of the tools and plugins we built over the last 5 years. However, some software may not have been built or tested in some time, and may require changes to be used with the latest VR software and technology. 

### Contributing and Contact
We welcome any and all interest in derivative projects made from this software, edits to the software, and updates to the plugins and drivers! If you are interested in contributing to the public Hardlight repositories, please create an issue, or email hardlightvr@gmail.com.
